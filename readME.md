An integrated driver monitoring system using OpenCV and dlib on a Raspberry Pi to track fatigue through eye and mouth aspect ratios, calculating a running fatigue score based on blink and yawn patterns. The ESP32-CAM streams live video over a custom webserver and displays real-time fatigue data via OLED. An onboard MQ3 sensor supports alcohol detection through a guided breathalyzer test, calibrated using controlled samples and baseline readings. A Flask server coordinates system behavior and enables mobile-based interaction, including optional emergency alert triggersâ€”no internet required. Each respective folder has the code associated with each device with the inclusion of schematics and PCB files. Made and designed by Julio Cornejo and Vincent Ng.
